# Treehacks2024's project: Tune.AI 

As the job market becomes more competitive and fiercer than ever, everyone experiences significant hardship when trying to find a job. The situation is not getting any better soon as layoffs occur more frequently and more people begin looking for jobs. On average, a single application yields an 8.3% chance of landing a job interview, and is even more difficult to secure an offer.  As such, Tune.AI aims to reduce the hassle of job search and matches you with the most suitable job!


# What it does

Tune.AI allows users to automatically tailor their resumes according to each specific job posting and also provide cover letters that match with everything on the users' resumes, the company the user is applying to, and the specific job posting's requirement. 

Tune.AI aims to help users increase their chance of landing interviews with fewer applications and in much less time, with higher accuracy of landing a job that matches their existing skillsets.
